# Code Snippets

Welcome to my "Code Snippets" repository!
In this repository, you will find a range of code snippets that I have developed to solve specific programming problems or explore different concepts. These snippets are intended to showcase my understanding of different languages' syntax, functions, control flow, and more.

While I am still in the early stages of my programming journey, I believe that these examples demonstrate my ability to apply my knowledge effectively. I hope they provide a glimpse into my coding style and problem-solving approach.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code snippets in this repository to see how I approach various programming challenges using JavaScript. Each snippet is contained in its own folder and includes comments explaining its purpose and functionality.

To use a snippet:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the file.
3. Copy the code snippet.
4. Paste it into the correct environment.
5. Run the code to see the results.
